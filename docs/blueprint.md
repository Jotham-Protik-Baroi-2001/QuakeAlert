# **App Name**: QuakeAlert

## Core Features:

- Sensor Data Collection: Collect and analyze accelerometer data from the phone to detect potential earthquake tremors.
- Earthquake Data Service Integration: Integrate with external earthquake data services (e.g., USGS API) to get real-time earthquake information.
- Android Earthquake Alert Service Integration: Integrate with earthquake alert services built into Android devices for broader coverage.
- Threshold Configuration: Allow users to configure sensitivity thresholds for earthquake detection to prevent false alarms.
- Location Tracking: Use device location to obtain more accurate earthquake information based on proximity. Make use of it as a tool to correlate local sensor data with external earthquake data.
- Customizable Alerts: Allow users to customize the type and urgency of alerts for different earthquake intensities.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) to convey trust and stability, drawing on associations with safety and authority.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F5), a desaturated version of the primary hue, provides a calm backdrop.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), analogous to the primary color, will highlight interactive elements and alerts.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for its modern, machined look, suitable for clarity in both headings and body text.
- Use clear and recognizable icons for earthquake detection and alert settings.
- Prioritize clarity and ease of use with a simple and intuitive user interface.
- Implement subtle animations to provide feedback on earthquake detection and alert status.
